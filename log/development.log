It failed to translate into more seats in parliament, but made Clegg viable as the deputy prime minister he then became. Ever since, it\\u0026#8217;s been bittersweet for the Lib Dem leader.

But the style of debating they\\u0026#8217;re used to doesn’t come across well on screen. \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/shortcuts/2015/jan/19/are-prime-ministers-questions-past-sell-by-date-as-nick-clegg-argues\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003EPrime Minister’s Questions\\u003C/a\\u003E is an arcane institution in which members of parliament gather every Wednesday lunchtime to perch or slouch on the green leather seats of the House of Commons, and shout at each other.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThere have been calls from many quarters to do away with the “\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/media/news/a622441/nick-clegg-calls-for-prime-ministers-questions-axe-its-a-farce.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Efarce\\u003C/a\\u003E,” which features aggressive and supremely old-fashioned insult-flinging, shouts of “shame!” and calls for “order, order.” It would be funny to watch if it wasn’t so boring, and didn’t represent the public face of British democracy.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn the latest round of television pre-election events, only one of which—tonight’s—is actually a debate in which politicians respond to one another, broadcasters are trying to do better. Both last week’s Channel 4/Sky program and tonight’s debate have a studio audience posing questions to the leaders. In last week\\u0026#8217;s, Jeremy Paxman, a career-griller of politicians, put Cameron and then Ed Milliband, the Labour leader, through their paces.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBut the effect was hollow. Both leaders, intent on not slipping up, stuck doggedly to the party line and trotted out a stream of stats to back up their arguments. They thanked the audience for questions, re-phrased them to change the meaning, and gave answers that sounded pre-prepared. This wasn’t a conversation, but a performance of listening, and a parody of communication.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EMaybe I, a British person unused to televised debate, am hoping for more than this limited format can offer. But I think most of us are watching not to hear a party line one more time, or even catch a stumble.

Nick Clegg, likely white knuckled but perhaps with little to lose, comes next. After him is Nigel Farage, leader of the UK Independence Party.

Less surprisingly, the Pentagon’s count also excludes secret (or secretive) American bases, like those reported in Israel and Saudi Arabia.

These toxins also impair the immune system and stunt children’s growth.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EPre- and post-harvest aflatoxin mitigation strategies, as well as dietary additives to bind ingestion aflatoxin, are often expensive and unsustainable. However, in Qidong, China, a former aflatoxin “hotspot,” 1 in 10 men succumbed to liver cancer by age 45 prior to market reforms of the 1980s.  Following increased trade with neighboring counties, residents of Qidong replaced corn with rice in the diet, and the liver cancer mortality rate was nearly cut in half over the next 30 years. This finding demonstrated that changing the diet to include foods that contain lower toxin levels may substantially improve public health.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EDiet diversification not only reduces intake of these toxins but may also provide nutrients that counteract the negative affects of the toxin. This is likely to be the case in communities that consume large amounts of bitter cassava. Adhering to traditional preparation methods of sun drying and/or soaking cassava for 2-3 days reduces cyanogenic glycosides to safe levels.\\u003Cspan class=\\\"pull-quote\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan\\u003EChildren are often at highest risk from adverse health effects.\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWithout proper preparation, which occurs during food shortages, cassava cyanide can cause neurocognitive and neuromuscular problems, including a condition of permanent paralysis called “konzo.” Increasing dietary sulfur amino acids, which aid in cyanide detoxification in the body, reduces the risk of konzo. A diverse diet less dependent on cassava and richer in sulfur amino acids found in eggs, dairy, meat and legumes can reduce cyanide poisoning.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EPromoting nutritional diversity, thus reducing toxin exposure and counteracting toxicity, is easier said than done.

There need to be changes to food policy, public health and education programs for farmers that encourage greater diversity of foods in diets, and reduce the proportion of foods that are known to contain naturally occurring toxins.

The actively disengaged group, meanwhile, can cost the US economy close to $400 billion per year. So not only are employees walking out the door because their bosses can\\u0026#8217;t or won\\u0026#8217;t engage them, but it also leaves a whole lot of money on the table.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u0026#8220;Engagement is strongly connected to business outcomes that are essential to an organization’s financial success, including productivity, profitability and customer ratings,\\u0026#8221; the report said. \\u0026#8220;And engaged employees are the ones who are the most likely to drive the innovation, growth and revenue that their companies desperately need.\\u0026#8221;\\u003Cb\\u003E \\u003C/b\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.govexec.com/excellence/promising-practices/2013/03/4-reasons-why-investing-employee-engagement-matters/62098/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003EOther recent reports\\u003C/a\\u003E corroborate Gallup\\u0026#8217;s conclusions: US federal agencies lose $65 billion per year from lost productivity alone, according to Deloitte.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIf there\\u0026#8217;s any type of silver lining, it\\u0026#8217;s that this lack of engagement is really only coming from one sex: Yes, you guessed it, men.

As described, the tentative accord seems to cut the deal somewhere in the middle of the two.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ESpeaking from the White House rose garden, Obama said the framework represented a \\u0026#8220;historic understanding with Iran\\u0026#8230; which if fully implemented will prevent it from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\\u0026#8221;\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cspan class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'\\u003E\\u003Ciframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/PiJ8fe1T6_E?version=3\\u0026#038;rel=1\\u0026#038;fs=1\\u0026#038;showsearch=0\\u0026#038;showinfo=1\\u0026#038;iv_load_policy=1\\u0026#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'\\u003E\\u003C/iframe\\u003E\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe rush by P5+1 to get something down on paper was entirely driven by American politics—a large, bipartisan well in the House and Senate, suspicious of Iran’s sincerity and trustworthiness, is keen to punish Tehran for not caving in more quickly. This urgency was criticized by France and others who said it played into Tehran’s hands, giving Iran another negotiating ace when it is in no hurry at all. Such critics may rightly look at American politics as a bizarre, small-time game of lots of hot air and a shortage of statesmanlike policy.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAs the negotiations enter their final phase, Iran may watch the stakes go up, mainly because of its own taste for brinksmanship. In the absence of a tangible, finalized deal, Congress is as likely as not to impose harsher sanctions, to be triggered right around July 1.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com\\u0026#038;blog=39587363\\u0026#038;post=375584\\u0026#038;subd=qzprod\\u0026#038;ref=\\u0026#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" /\\u003E\",\"comments\":\"http://qz.com/375584/iran-has-blinked-bringing-negotiators-to-a-preliminary-agreement-on-a-nuclear-deal/#comments\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-04-02T11:31:42-07:00\",\"category\":\"Uncategorized\",\"guid\":\"http://qz.com/?p=375584\",\"dc_creator\":\"Steve LeVine\",\"media_content_url\":\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/irantalks.jpg?w=640\",\"media_content_type\":\"html\",\"media_title\":\"irantalks\",\"media_thumbnail_url\":\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/irantalks.jpg?w=640\"}"], ["link", "http://qz.com/375584/iran-has-blinked-bringing-negotiators-to-a-preliminary-agreement-on-a-nuclear-deal/"], ["published_at", Thu, 02 Apr 2015 18:31:42 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Iran has blinked, bringing negotiators to a preliminary agreement on a nuclear deal"], ["updated_at", Thu, 02 Apr 2015 20:58:05 UTC +00:00]]

Its affiliation with Twitter seems like a real strength, considering Twitter\\u0026#8217;s distribution power, its ability to directly integrate Periscope, and its relationships with media and celebrities. But it\\u0026#8217;s hardly clear if this will be a winner-take-all market—or whether live streaming will simply become a feature of every social product, from Snapchat to WhatsApp. (And—if so—if someone will purchase Meerkat for a lot of money.)\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u0026#8220;This is not a zero-sum game,\\u0026#8221; Josh Elman, the Greylock partner who just led Meerkat\\u0026#8217;s \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.greylock.com/investment-meerkat-power-spontaneous-togetherness/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003E$12 million financing round\\u003C/a\\u003E, tells Quartz. (In addition to working in product roles at Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn, Elman started his career at RealNetworks, the 1990s streaming video pioneer, and has watched the industry evolve over 18 years.)\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u0026#8220;The number of multi-billion-dollar companies around the distribution, programming, and content of live video is massive,\\u0026#8221; Elman says, calling out the uniquely interactive and participatory nature of this new wave of mobile services. \\u0026#8220;There\\u0026#8217;s so much opportunity here, it\\u0026#8217;s crazy.\\u0026#8221;\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe bigger question: Is this new market going to last?

From a practical standpoint, mobile networks are now fast enough in many places to support high-quality video streaming. (Our early experience with these services, however, has been flaky.) Screens are bigger, and people are simply \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://qz.com/365293/it-took-a-decade-but-mobile-video-is-finally-exploding/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ewatching more video on their phones\\u003C/a\\u003E.

In our experience so far, some streams have been pleasant, such as a live view of Tokyo\\u0026#8217;s Shibuya crossing. Some have been amusing. Others have been grotesque, such as a man using the toilet. None has been worth watching for more than a few moments.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe real magic seems to be the immediacy and breadth of available streams. There are still some questions to be worked out around the incentives for people to create and watch streams, especially once the initial curiosity and experimentation wears off. But there seems to be something here. The real key for Meerkat and Periscope, now, is to build the best possible tools for creating and participating in these streams, and making them an essential part of millions of lives.
